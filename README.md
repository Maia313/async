### Testing 


`Karma` is not a testing framework, nor an assertion library. `Karma` just launches an `HTTP server`, and generates the test runner HTML file you probably already know from your favourite testing framework. So for testing purposes you can use pretty much anything you like. There are already plugins for most of the common testing frameworks:

1. `Jasmine`
1. `Mocha`
1. `QUnit`
`and many others`


`Using Mocha`

+ tests are organized into test suites
